#  MebasaBali

I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who have helped me to finish this app. They have helped me to refine my app flow, support me by voicing the audio, point out the thing that I overlooked, and cheering me to finish this app. Without their help, I wouldn't be able to finish this app as great as it's now.

There are many foreigners who decided to live in Bali and most of them wanted to learn the language but lacked the resources. Therefore, MebasaBali is an app that helps foreigners to learn Balinese language. By speaking Balinese language, the relationship between foreigners and the local people will be better because the act of speaking Balinese shows respect to the local people and in turn the local people tend to respect back.

I also would like to express my gratitude to Apple for holding this Swift Student Challenge as I believe this event motivate a lot of student to create something that solve an important problem for them.

Sincerely,
I Dewa Gede Bisma Mahendra
